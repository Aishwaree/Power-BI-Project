# Power-BI-Project
This is my first personal project using Power BI. I visualised a years worth of bank statements. I first had to clean the data on Excel. See the gif in the attachments for a walkthrough of the visualisation!

Please note, I have blurred out the y-axis to maintain confidentiality.
